## Background and Putting the Results in Context (20%)

* **FL (0-49%)**: The student has not done a good job explaining the research
aims to the reader. Not really sure what this is about.
* **PS (50-64%)**: I understand the project aims but the student has not made
it clear to the reader how it is connected to the background why is this aim
being pursued? What is the hypothesis being tested? What is the broader
significance?
* **CR (65-74%)**: The student makes the project background clear to the reader,
and the significance of the research aim within a broader context. The
student has not been able to take a step back and make an assessment of the
significance of their results.
* **DN (75-84%)**: The student makes the project background clear to the reader,
and the significance of the research aim within a broader context. The
literature review is comprehensive but may be lacking depth of insight. The
student has made a reasonable attempt to assess the significance of their
results, but it is either not realistic, or does not follow logically from the
arguments presented.
* **HD (85-100%)**: Clear articulation of the significance of the research aim within
a broader context, as well as realistic assessment of the outcome. The literature
review is comprehensive and insightful.

## Execution of the Research Project, Quality of Analysis, Discussion of Results (50%)

* **FL (0-49%)**: Work at this level is clearly deficient in not addressing
the stated project aims or in containing major problems that the student
should reasonably have been aware of but did not address in the
thesis.
* **PS (50-64%)**: A completed body of work and some results, but not
succeeded in interpreting meaning from them [intellectual input is largely
absent from the discussion]. Performance at this level may also indicate a
lack of engagement with the project, sometimes evidenced as a "thin" or "one-
dimensional" work characterised by attempted padding.
* **CR (65-74%)**: The student probably has a number of components to their
research, such as literature, experiments, designs, simulations etc. They have
interpreted meaning from the results but have overall not succeeded in linking
the components of their research together as a coherent scientific story.
There's no clear "big picture".
* **DN (75-84%)**: At this level the student has assembled the pieces of their
research project (which could include literature, different sets of
experiments or measurements, simulations or analyses) into a coherent
scientific story. Overall, you are left with a clear and convincing picture of
what the research question was and what the answer is (along with its caveats)
indicating no problems in conceptual or methodological problems with their work.
* **HD (85-100%)**: Student would have to have achieved as at the previous
level but additionally has achieved something unexpected, thoughtful and
original, such as a novel perspective or theory. This requires deep thinking
of the student.

## Conclusions, and Value Added (20%)

* **FL (0-49%)**: There are obvious and substantial problems with what was
presented - the work as it stands has no value because it doesn't "hold water".
* **PS (50-64%)**: The presented work is not at all challenging and yields
entirely expected results - the student does not appear to appreciate this.
The work doesn't really add any significant value.
* **CR (65-74%)**: The work adds some value in some way - improvement of "
local knowledge" such as techniques, additional data points in a larger design
or hypothesis etc. The student worked well but did not make new discoveries or
interpretations, therefore the conclusions are limited, and discussions of
future work are predictable extensions of the work completed.
* **DN (75-84%)**: The results and discussion can eventually form the core of
a research publication or change in industry practice (It may have already
been included in a conference publication during the course of the thesis).
However, further work will first be required - such as repeated experiments -
before the work is truly sufficient. The student has included good, thoughtful
discussion of limitations and provided insight into future work on this
project or new avenues of research which could be
followed.
* **HD (85-100%)**: This is valuable work. This work can easily form the basis of
a peer-reviewed journal publication, or other form of professional
dissemination/presentation appropriate to the field.

## Document Presentation (10%)

* **FL (0-49%)**: Presentation is poor to the extent that it impedes reading
of the document. Examples include multiple inconsistent citation styles or
incomplete citations, unintelligible grammar, figures or tables not labelled
or badly inconsistent document formatting.
* **PS (50-64%)**: Document is not at a professional level. Although figures
and diagrams are labelled and references in text match reference list (and
vice versa), formatting is unclear and inconsistent to the extent that the
reader can lose track of the context when reading. The structure of the
document is poor or illogical, with little discernible flow.
* **CR (65-74%)**: Document is not at a professional level. Figures, diagrams
and sections are labelled, formatting is consistent, references are properly
listed and cited. An attempt might have been made to "pad" the work using
unnecessary, repetitive, or large figures, wide margins, etc. The language is
not sophisticated or sufficient for describing the technical aspects clearly
and rigorously, and there are disjointed aspects to the structure.
* **DN (75-84%)**: Document is at a professional level. Figures and diagrams,
sections are labelled, formatting is consistent, references in text match
reference list . and good use made of appendices. Minor issues [e.g., some of
the graphical presentation of data is inappropriate poor choice of axes,
overcrowding, poor use of chart space etc.]. Padding is not a feature of work
at this level. The structure is well thought out and logical, and there is a
good command of descriptive and technical language - descriptions and
explanations have depth but clarity and are concisely worded.

* **HD (85-100%)**: Document is at a professional level. No notable issues.
The language has fluency, depth and clarity.
