\chapter*{Abstract}
Databases are used extensively by almost every system. With the recent 
advances in secondary storage (SSDs, NVMe), and compiler technology 
(MLIR), the opportunities to improve them continues to improve. Since 
they are widely used, the cost of powering all the databases is high, and
lowering this slightly can have large impacts. This thesis investigates this
by reviewing the current state of the literature, gaps in the literature,
and proposes a project to explore this by extending PostgreSQL with MLIR.
