\chapter*{Abstract}
With the advancement of hardware research, many modern battle-tested databases
underutilise their caches and disk read speeds due to them being designed
when I/O was the bottleneck. This thesis proposes pgx-lower, which demonstrates
how just-in-time compilation from a research system can be retrofitted
into an established database using its extension system. By integrating LingoDB's
MLIR-based JIT compiler into PostgreSQL, a columnar in-memory compile was adapted
into a disk-oriented architecture while maintaining ACID properties and MVCC
support. The evaluations on TPC-H showed improved branch prediction and
cache efficiency compared to the original executor. More importantly,
pgx-lower demonstrates that a production database can adopt modern
compiler techniques as third-party extensions, providing a practical
pathway for database research productionisation.
