\subsection{Database Background}\label{subsec:database_background}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
The majority of databases are structured like Figure~\ref{fig:database_structure}.
Structure Query Language (SQL) is parsed, turned to RA (relational-algebra),
optimized, executed, then materialized into a table.

\end{figure}

For non-compiler databases they use a volcano operator model tree, such as
Figure~\ref{fig:execution_tree}The root node has a \texttt{produce()} function
which calls its children's \texttt{produce()}, until it calls a leave node,
which calls \texttt{consume()} on itself, then that calls its parent's
\texttt{consume()} function. In other words, a post-order traversal through
this tree where tuples are dragged upwards.

\begin{figure}[H]

	\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{figures/execution-tree.png}
	\caption{Volcano operator model tree.}
	\label{fig:execution_tree}
	\cite{long-masters-thesis}
\end{figure}

The fundamental issue with this classical model is that it is heavily
under utilising the hardware. If we are only pulling up a single tuple, our CPU
caches are barely used. This has lead to the vectorized execution model and
the compiled model. With the vectorized model, we pull up groups of tuples
instead. However, this leads to problems where it's common to have too many
copy operations instead of having a pointer going upwards. For instance, if a
sort or a join allocates new space that is too much for the cache, the
handling can become poor. With the compiled approach, it introduces a lot of
implementation complexity.

Relational databases prioritise ACID requirements - Atomicity, Consistency,
Isolation and Durability \cite{database-concepts}. This is a critical
requirement in this type of system, and usually one of the main reasons people
pick a relational database. Atomicity refers to transactions are a single unit
of work, consistency means it must be in a valid state before and after the
query, isolation means concurrent transactions do not interact with each other,
and durability means once something is committed it will stay committed.
\cite{database-concepts}

It is common for on-disk databases to consider the cost of CPU operations to
be $O(1)$ \cite{database-concepts}. This is partially due to when these
systems were made, the disks were much slower and the caches were much slower.
In part A of this project, this was disproved for PostgreSQL as it was found
that the time spent in the CPU was substantial: between $34.87\%$ and $76.56\%$
with an average of $49.32\%$ across the tested queries.

\subsection{JIT Background}\label{subsec:jit_background}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Just-in-time (JIT) compilers function by having multiple layers of compilation and
are mostly used by interpreted languages to eliminate the ill-effects on
performance \cite{long-masters-thesis}. Advanced compilers can run the primary
program, then dedicate some background threads to improving the optimisation
of the code, and swap it over to the optimized version when it is ready
\cite{hyper-compiler-2}.

Due to branch-prediction optimization, JIT compilers can become faster than
ahead of time compilers. In 1999, a benchmarking paper measured four
commercial databases and found $10\%-20\%$ of their execution time was spent
fixing poor predictions \cite{branch-misprediction}. similarly, research
specifically into branch prediction has said, "although branch prediction
attained 99\% accuracy in predicting static branches, ... branches are still a
major bottleneck in the system performance" \cite{branch-prediction-values}.
Modern measurements still find 50\% of their query times are spent resolving
hardware hazards, such as mispredictions, with improvements in this area
making their queries 2.6x faster \cite{dbms-branches}. The Azul JIT compiler
measured that their JIT solution's speculative optimizations can lead up to $50\%$
performance gains \cite{azul_jit_aot}.

In the context of databases, most compilers can be split into only compiling
expressions (typically called EXP for expression), and others that compile the
entire Query Execution Plan (QEP) \cite{empirical-analysis}. Within PostgreSQL
itself, they have EXP support using $llvm-jit$.

The LLVM Project is a compiler infrastructure that supports making compilers
so that common, but complex, compiler optimisations do not have to be re-
implemented. Multi-Level Intermediate Representation is another, newer toolkit
that is tightly coupled with the LLVM project. It adds a framework to define
dialects, and lower through these dialects. One of the primary benefits of
this is if you make a compiler, you can define a high level dialect, then
another person can target your custom high-level dialect.

\subsection{PostgreSQL Background}\label{subsec:postgresql-background}
% TODO: Provide sources
An arena allocator is a data structure that supports allocating memory and freeing
the entire data structure. This improves memory safety by consolidating
allocations into a single location. Within PostgreSQL, memory contexts are used
which is an advancement of this concept. There is a set of statically defined
memory contexts (TopMemoryContext, TopTransactionContext, CurTransactionContext,
TransactionContext, they are defined in the mmgr README), and with these you
can create child contexts. When a context is freed, all the child contexts are
also freed.

PostgreSQL defines query trees, plan trees, plan nodes, and expression nodes.
A query tree is the initial version of the parsed SQL, which is passed through
the optimiser which is then called a plan tree. The nodes in these plan trees
can broadly be identified as plan nodes or expression nodes.
Plan nodes include an implementation detail (aggregation, scanning a table,
nest loop joins) and expression nodes consist of individual operations (binaryop,
null test, case expressions).
% TODO: Include a graph of the PostgreSQL path and annotate in the previous 
% paragraph where the nodes are produced

\section{Related Works}\label{sec:related-works}
%================================================================================ 

This following section summarises relevant works in the compiled queries
space, and their architectures. Originally, the industry began with compiled
query engines, but this was overtaken by volcano models as they simplified the
implementation details with little cost at the time. However, now analytical
engines are examining compilers again.

In subsection~\ref{subsec:system-r} system R will be explored as the
classical example, followed by HyPer and Umbra in
subsection~\ref{subsec:hyper} and subsection~\ref{subsec:umbra} which re-introduced the concept. Mutable
in subsection~\ref{subsec:mutable} and LingoDB in subsection~\ref{subsec:lingodb}
are research databases. Lastly, PostgreSQL will be examined in
subsection~\ref{subsec:postgresql-related} as it uses expression-based
compilation and there has been an attempt to create a compiled engine before.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
\subsection{System R}\label{subsec:system-r}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
System R is a flagship paper in the databasing space that introduced SQL,
compiling engines, and ACID. Their vision described ACID requirements, but was
explained as seven dot points as it was not a concept yet. Their goal was to
run at a "level of performance comparable to existing lower-function database
systems." Reviewers commented that the compiler is the most important part of
the design.

Due to the implementation overhead of parsing, validity checking, and access
path selection, a compiler was appealing. These were not supported within the
running transaction by default, and they leveraged pre-compiled fragments of
Cobol for the reused functions to improve their compile times. This was
completely custom-made at the time because there were not many tools to support
writing compilers. System R shows the idea of compiled queries is as old
as databases, and over time the priorities of the systems changed.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
\subsection{HyPer}\label{subsec:hyper}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
% TODO: lol, poorly written paragraph
% TODO: Maybe need to comment why we're going into so much detail on HyPer.
HyPer was a flagship system, and Umbra supersedes it. Both were made
by Thomas Neumann, and the core sign is of its viability is that HyPer
was purchased by ableau in 2016 to be used in production. This shows
that it is is possible to use an in-memory JIT database at scale. The project
began in 2010, with their flagship paper releasing in 2011 for the compiler
component, and in 2018 they released another flagship paper about
adaptive compilation. However, the database being commercialised poses issues
for outside research because the source code is not accessible, but there is a
binary on their website that can be used for benchmarking.

Their 2011 paper on the compiler identifies that translating queries into C or
C++ introduced significant overhead compared to compiling into LLVM. As a result,
they suggested using pre-compiled C++ objects of common functions then
inlining them into the LLVM IR. This LLVM IR is executed by the LLVM's JIT
executor. By utilising LLVM IR, they can take advantage of overflow flags and
strong typing which prevent numerous bugs in their original C++ approach.

% include OLAP performance here

HyPer shows they reduced their compile time by doing this in figure XYZ by many
multiples, and in figure ABC they show they achieve many times less branches,
branch mispredicts, and other measurements compared to their baseline of MonetDB.
The cause of this is HyPer's output had less code in the compiled queries.

% branching and cache locality

Hyper continues on in 2018 where they separated the compiler into multiple rounds.
They introduced an interpreter on the byte code generated from LLVM IR, then they
can run unoptimised machine code, and on the final stage they can run optimised
machine code. Figure XYZ visualises this with the compile times of each stage.
However, they had to create the byte code interpreter themselves to enable this.

The 2018 paper also improved their query optimisation by adding a dynamic
measurement for how long live queries are taking. This is because the
optimiser's cost model did not lead to accurate measurements for compilation
timing. Instead, they introduced an execution stage for workers, then
in a "work-stealing" stage they log how long the job took. With a combination
of the measurements and the query plan, they calculate estimates for jobs
and optimal levels to compile them to.

This was benchmarked with TPC-H Query 11 using 4 threads, and they found
the adaptive execution was faster than only using bytecode by $40\%$, unoptimised
compilation by $10\%$ and optimised compilation by $80\%$. The cause of this is that
the compilation stage is single threaded, while with multiple threads they can
compile in the background while execution is running.

Utilising additional stages of the LLVM compiler, improving the cost model, and
supporting multi threading the compilation and execution combined into a viable
JIT compiled-query application. The primary criticism is that they effectively
wrote the JIT compiler from the ground-up, which requires large amounts
of engineering time. Majority of the additions here are not unique to a database's
JIT compiler, and are mostly ways to target the compiler's latency.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
\subsection{HyPer}\label{subsec:umbra}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Umbra was created in 2020 by Thomas Neumann, the creator of HyPer, and the
main change is that they show it is possible to use the in-memory database
concepts from HyPer inside of an on-disk database. The core reason for this is
the recent improvements of SSDs and buffer management advances. They take
concepts from LeanStore for the buffer management and latches, then multi-version
concurrency, compilation, and execution strategies from HyPer. This combination
led to an on-disk database that is scalable, flexible and faster than HyPer.

% perforamnce figure

% I skipped a paragraph about multi-level debugger here

A novel optimisation they introduced later was enabling the compiler to
change the query plan. That is, they can use the metrics collected during
execution to swap the order of joins, or the type of join being used.
This improved the runtime of the data-centric queries by two-times. Some other
databases introduce this concept by invoking the query optimiser multiple
times, but since their compiler is invoked multiple times during execution this
adds additional benefit.

% graph with adaptive query processing

Umbra is currently ranked as the most effective database on Clickhouse's
benchmarking. The main complaint of the compiler being too heavy is still there,
but it shows the advantage of having direct access to the JIT compiler with
its adaptive compilation to change optimisation choices.
% I wonder if I can say more was included in the original literature review?
% I guess the thesis is a standalone work though haha

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
\subsection{Mutable}\label{subsec:mutable}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
In 2023, Mutable presented the concept of using a low latency JIT
compiler (WebAssembly) rather than a heavy one in their initial paper.
Its primary purpose, however, is to serve as a framework for implementing other
concepts in database research so that they do not need to rewrite the framework
later. However, using WebAssembly meant they can omit most of the optimisations
that HyPer did while maintaining a higher of performance. Furthermore, they have
a minimal query optimiser and instead rely on the V8 engine.

The V8 engine contains a "Liftoff" component that adds an early-stage execution
step to lower the initial overhead of running the query. The liftoff component
produces machine code as fast as possible while skipping opimisations, then
"turbofan" is a second-stage compiler that runs in the background
while execution is running. However, HyPer has a direct bytecode interpreter
which can result in a lower time to execution.

% compilation phase graph

Mutable's benchmarks show they achieve similar compile and execution times to
HyPer, and outperform them in many cases. While pushing this system to the
same performance as HyPer or Umbra would require re-architecting, the achieved
performance compared to the implementation effort is a significant outcome.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
\subsection{LingoDB}\label{subsec:lingodb}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
% I skipped the overview, 
LingoDB piloted in 2022 and proposed using the MLIR framework to create the
optimisation layers. In most databases, the system parses the SQL into a
query tree, then relational algebra, then this is optimised using manual
implementations, and parse this into a plan tree for execution, or compile
this into a binary. With MLIR, this pipeline changes into parsing the plan
tree into a high-level dialect in MLIR, then doing optimisation passes on the
plan itself, and the LLVM compiler can be used directly to turn this into
LLVM, streamlining the process.

% todo lol
The LingoDB architecture can be seen in figure XYZ, which begins by parsing the
SQL into a relational algebra dialect. These dialects are defined using
MLIR's dialect system, and supported through code generation. Their compiler
is defined by a relational algebra dialect, a database dialect that represents
SOMETHING, a DSA dialect that represents, a utility dialect that represents
SOMETHING, and the final LLVM output. This splits the state of the intermediate
representation into three stages: relational algebra, a mixed dialect, and
finally the LLVM.

Their result is that they are less performant than HyPer, but do better than
DuckDB. This performance is not their key output, rather, it is that they can
implement the standard optimisation patterns within the compiler. Another feat
is that they are approximately 10,000 lines of code in the query execution model,
and Mutable is at 22,944 lines for their code despite skipping query
optimisation. Within LingoDB's paper they also compare this to being three times
less than DuckDB and five times less than NoisePage.

% FIGURE

% idk why \texttt doesn't work here.
For our purposes, the appealing part of their architecture is that they use
$pg_query$ to parse the incoming SQL, which means their parser is the closest
to PostgreSQL's. This will be explored in the design in REFERENCE.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
\subsection{PostgreSQL}\label{subsec:postgresql-related}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
PostgreSQL is a battle-tested system and is currently the most
popular database in the world with $51.9$ of developers in a stackoverflow survey
saying they use it extensively in 2024. Within the context of compiled queries this means
the database itself cannot be treated as a research system. Changes directly to
it requires heavy-testing, but also, these changes will not be peer-reviewed
research. Instead, it is pull-requests online with more casual interaction.

There has been significant discussion about HyPer and JIT with regards to 
PostgreSQL in 2017. The general response is doubt that someone will add support 
for full compiling full query expressions, and rearchitecting such a core 
component introduces large risk.

However, in September 2017 Andres Freudn started implementing JIT support for 
expressions. The reasoning was that most of the CPU time is in the expression 
components, (e.g. y > 8 in SELECT * from table WHERE x > 8;).



%================================================================================ 
\section{Aims}\label{sec:lit-rev}
%================================================================================ 
The core goal of this project is to create a compiled execution engine for PostgreSQL
that uses the QEP compiler model instead of its existing EXP model and evaluate
whether this has the potential to out-perform PostgreSQL itself. This will be
done with the MLIR infrastructure from LingoDB to support it (which will be
introduced in the literature survey). It was created to support TPC-H queries
and re-route any unsupported queries back to the regular PostgreSQL engine.
