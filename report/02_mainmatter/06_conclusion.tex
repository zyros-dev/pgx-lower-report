\chapter{Conclusion}\label{ch:conclusion}
pgx-lower demonstrates that JIT-compiled query execution can be integrated
into production databases via extensions. We retrofitted LingoDB's compiler
into PostgreSQL while maintaining ACID properties, achieving improved
branch prediction and cache efficiency on TPC-H. The key contribution
is methodological. Extension mechanisms provide a practical pathway for
productionising database research without rewrites or official integration.

While only partial query coverage was implemented and performance is mixed,
pgx-lower validates that production databases can adopt modern compiler
techniques through extensions rather than from-scratch implementations. This
bridges the gap between academic prototypes and production systems, suggesting
a more realistic research methodology.

Future work was proposed and discussed, including implementing all the
plan and expression nodes in the executor, improving the runtime, or pivoting
and targetting a different database system, compiler, or language in
subsection~\ref{subsec:future-work}.
