\chapter{Conclusion}\label{ch:conclusion}
pgx-lower demonstrates that JIT-compiled query execution can be integrated
into production databases via extensions. The implementation retrofits LingoDB's compiler
into PostgreSQL while maintaining ACID properties, achieving improved
branch prediction and cache efficiency on TPC-H. The key contribution
is methodological. Extension mechanisms provide a practical pathway for
productionising database research without rewrites or official integration.

While the implementation covers only part of the query space and performance is mixed,
pgx-lower validates that production databases can adopt modern compiler
techniques through extensions rather than from-scratch implementations. This
bridges the gap between academic prototypes and production systems, suggesting
a more realistic research methodology.

Future work includes implementing all the
plan and expression nodes in the executor, improving the runtime, or pivoting
and targeting a different database system, compiler, or language, as discussed in
Subsection~\ref{subsec:future-work}.
