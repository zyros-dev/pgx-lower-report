\chapter{Introduction}

Databases have been used widely for a long time. Nowadays,
they are the main bottleneck in many systems - especially on web servers and
other large data applications \cite{ddia}. They are a critical component
of many systems and a fundamental reason why these can function.

As modern hardware advances, the optimal algorithms for supporting databases changes.
In the last several years, CPU cache sizes have become larger and secondary storage has
become faster. Older databases assume that operations inside the CPU are constant
due to the overhead of reading from disk, but this might not be true. One way to support 
modern hardware is to use a just in time compiler instead of the existing model.

In this thesis, the necessary background will be introduced in Chapter~\ref{ch:background}.
The current literature on this topic will be explored in Chapter~\ref{ch:lit-review}, and 
a project to explore this further will be defined in Chapter~\ref{ch:project-plan}. This 
will be followed by Chapter~\ref{ch:prelim} where the preliminary results and skills required
will be explored.
