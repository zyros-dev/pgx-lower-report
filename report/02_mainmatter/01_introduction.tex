\chapter{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
Databases are a heavily used type of system that rely on correctness and speed.
Nowadays, they are often the primary bottleneck in many systems - especially
on webservers and other large data applications \cite{ddia}.

With modern hardware advances, the optimal way to structure these databases has
drastically changed, but most databases are using architectures defined by older
hardware. Older databases assume the disk operations are the vast majority of
runtime, but that has shifted to the CPU for heavy queries.

In this thesis, PostgreSQL's execution engine was replaced with a compiler
to support more optimal usage of the CPU. This paper is split into a
background in Chapter~\ref{ch:background} which includes fundamental concepts
and the definition/goal of the project, then a light literature survey will
be conducted in Chapter~\ref{ch:lit-survey}. The project's solution will
be introduced in Chapter~\ref{ch:project}, and finally conclusions will be
drawn in Chapter~\ref{ch:conclusion}.
